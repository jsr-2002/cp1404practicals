# REFLECTION

## What is something you have done well in this subject that you should keep doing in future subjects?
I have consistently used version control (branches + PRs) and improved my code quality using clean coding principles.

## What is something you have not done well in this subject that you should stop doing in future subjects?
I sometimes skipped small tests and rushed tasks. I will stop doing that to improve code reliability.

## What is something new that you could try or start doing in future subjects?
Using test-driven development (write tests before writing actual logic).

## What do you think is the best, most important, most fun... thing in this subject that we should definitely keep?
Code reviews and the practicals involving GUIs, Flask, and Web APIs. They’re hands-on and industry-relevant.

## What do you think is the worst, biggest waste of time, least fun... thing in this subject that we should definitely change?
Editing large chunks of HTML manually could be automated or templated better.
