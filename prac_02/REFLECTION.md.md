# Reflection – Practical 02

## What are you most confident with so far?
I am confident with writing functions, following the standard program structure, and using the Single Responsibility Principle. I can separate logic into functions and reuse them when needed.

## What are you least confident with so far?
I am least confident with remembering all the Git and GitHub steps, especially staging, committing, and pushing correctly every time.

## What have you struggled with so far, and what strategies have you used to try to overcome this?
I struggled with refactoring older programs into functions because sometimes I mixed input/print logic inside them. To fix this, I carefully reread the instructions and used PyCharm’s refactor tool to extract methods.

## What do you want to do differently in the next practical?
I want to plan my functions before writing the code, instead of writing everything in `main()` and then moving them. This should make my programs cleaner and easier to debug.

## What have you learned about GitHub and using version control?
I learned how to commit with clear messages in the imperative mood, how to push files to GitHub, and why version control is important for tracking changes and collaborating.
